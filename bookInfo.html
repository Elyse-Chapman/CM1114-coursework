				<h3>Summary - </h3>
				<p><b>Ambition will fuel him. Competition will drive him. But power has its price.</b></p>
				<p>It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In the Capitol, eighteen-year-old 
					Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a mentor in the Games. The once-mighty house 
					of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to 
					outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute.</p>

				<p>The odds are against him. He's been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute from 
					District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined — every choice Coriolanus 
					makes could lead to favour or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. 
					Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute... and must weigh his need to follow the
					rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.</p>
